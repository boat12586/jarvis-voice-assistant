- **Memory Management**: Implemented document cleanup and memory monitoring
- **Vector Store**: Fixed persistence issues and improved error recovery

#### AI Model Configuration
- **Embedding Model**: mxbai-embed-large working with fallback to all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **LLM Model**: DeepSeek-R1 with intelligent fallback to DialoGPT
- **Quantization**: 8-bit quantization for GPU systems, none for CPU
- **Context Length**: Adaptive based on system capabilities (4096 GPU, 2048 CPU)
