# JARVIS Voice Assistant Project Overview

## Project Vision

JARVIS Voice Assistant is a state-of-the-art, locally-run AI system inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man. The system features advanced reasoning capabilities through DeepSeek-R1, superior semantic understanding via mxbai-embed-large, and natural voice interaction powered by F5-TTS. With the new Live AI Agent enhancement, JARVIS will gain real-time conversation capabilities, specialized agent personalities, and an immersive sci-fi holographic matrix interface.
