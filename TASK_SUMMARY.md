- Develop advanced RAG system

### Phase 3: Sci-Fi Hologram Matrix UI Development (Weeks 4-5)
- Develop UI infrastructure
- Develop core UI components
- Develop interaction systems

### Phase 4: Live AI Agent Development (Weeks 6-8)
- Develop real-time audio system
- Develop specialized agent system
- Develop advanced context management
- Develop comprehensive English learning system
- Develop skill teaching system

### Phase 5: Optimization and Testing (Week 8)
- Optimization
- Testing
- Documentation

### Phase 6: Integration and Deployment (Week 8)
- Integrate all components
- Create deployment package
- Final testing and optimization

## Immediate Priority Tasks

1. **Fix mxbai-embed-large Integration Issues**
   - Check model download status
   - Fix embedding dimension compatibility issues
   - Enhance error handling

2. **Integrate DeepSeek-R1**
   - Verify model download and installation
   - Update LLMEngine class
   - Enhance prompt template system

3. **Develop Voice Command System**
   - Develop wake word detection
   - Improve voice command recognition
   - Develop natural language command interpretation

## Performance Targets

- **Total Response Time**: <10 seconds
- **Audio Latency**: <200ms
- **Memory Usage**: <8GB RAM, <6GB VRAM
- **Speech Recognition Accuracy**: >95%
- **Knowledge Retrieval Accuracy**: >85%

## Development Considerations

- **Optimization**: Use 8-bit quantization, dynamic model loading/unloading
- **Privacy**: All processing on-device, secure data storage
- **Customization**: Allow users to adjust UI complexity and effects
- **Hardware Support**: Adapt to available hardware capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 implementation by fixing model integration issues
2. Test performance of new models
3. Start advanced feature development according to plan
