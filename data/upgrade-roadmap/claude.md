# Claude AI Project Context

## Project Overview

This workspace contains a comprehensive upgrade roadmap specification for an AI project. The goal is to create a structured plan for evolving an AI system across multiple versions, addressing current limitations while introducing new features and improvements.

## Current Status

We are working on implementing the upgrade roadmap based on the completed specification documents:

- **Requirements**: ✅ Complete - Defines 6 main requirements covering versioning strategy, limitations assessment, and planned improvements
- **Design**: ✅ Complete - Outlines the architecture and approach for creating the roadmap
- **Tasks**: ✅ Complete - Contains 9 main implementation tasks with detailed subtasks

## Key Context for SuperClaude

### What This Project Does
This project creates a comprehensive upgrade roadmap document that will:
- Define a clear versioning strategy for an AI project
- Assess current limitations and bottlenecks
- Plan improvements across multiple versions (v1.5, v2.0, v2.5+)
- Provide structured documentation in Markdown format

### Current Implementation Status
The specification phase is complete. We are now ready to execute the implementation tasks to create the actual upgrade roadmap document.

### Next Steps
The implementation involves creating a detailed upgrade roadmap document with:
1. Versioning strategy section
2. Current limitations assessment
3. Minor version improvements (v1.5)
4. Major version improvements (v2.0)
5. Future enhancements (v2.5+)
6. Timeline visualization using Mermaid diagrams

### Important Notes for Implementation
- The final document should be saved either as a section in this claude.md file or as a separate upgrade_plan.md file
- All content should be in Markdown format with proper structure
- Include Mermaid diagrams for timeline visualization
- Ensure backward compatibility considerations for v1.5
- Document breaking changes and migration paths for v2.0

## Task Execution Guidelines

When executing tasks from the tasks.md file:
1. Read the requirements.md and design.md files first for context
2. Execute only one task at a time
3. Focus on the specific requirements referenced in each task
4. Ensure all content is properly formatted in Markdown
5. Stop after completing each task for review

## Communication
- Primary language: Thai (ภาษาไทย) for communication
- Documentation language: English for technical content
- The user prefers concise, direct communication
