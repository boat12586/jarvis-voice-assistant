# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive upgrade roadmap for an AI project. The roadmap will detail the versioning strategy, current limitations, and planned improvements across multiple versions (e.g., v1 → v1.5 → v2.0 and beyond). The goal is to provide a clear path for future development that addresses current limitations while introducing new features and improvements in a structured manner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Versioning Strategy

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a clear versioning strategy, so that I can communicate changes effectively to users and developers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the versioning strategy THEN the system SHALL specify whether semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) or milestone-based versioning is used
2. WHEN defining the versioning strategy THEN the system SHALL explain the criteria for incrementing each version number
3. WHEN defining the versioning strategy THEN the system SHALL provide guidelines for version numbering of pre-releases, if applicable
4. WHEN defining the versioning strategy THEN the system SHALL explain how breaking changes are handled in the versioning scheme

### Requirement 2: Current Limitations Assessment

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to identify current limitations and performance bottlenecks, so that I can prioritize improvements in future versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing current limitations THEN the system SHALL identify performance bottlenecks in the current version
2. WHEN assessing current limitations THEN the system SHALL identify functional limitations in the current version
3. WHEN assessing current limitations THEN the system SHALL identify user experience issues in the current version
4. WHEN assessing current limitations THEN the system SHALL categorize limitations by severity and impact
5. WHEN assessing current limitations THEN the system SHALL link limitations to specific components or modules

### Requirement 3: Minor Version Improvements (v1.5)

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to plan minor enhancements and bug fixes for the next minor release, so that I can improve the product incrementally without major disruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning minor version improvements THEN the system SHALL list specific bug fixes to be addressed
2. WHEN planning minor version improvements THEN the system SHALL describe performance optimizations to be implemented
3. WHEN planning minor version improvements THEN the system SHALL outline refactoring efforts to improve code quality
4. WHEN planning minor version improvements THEN the system SHALL specify any minor feature enhancements
5. WHEN planning minor version improvements THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility with the current version

### Requirement 4: Major Version Improvements (v2.0)

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to plan major feature upgrades and architectural changes for the next major release, so that I can significantly enhance the product's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning major version improvements THEN the system SHALL describe architectural redesigns to be implemented
2. WHEN planning major version improvements THEN the system SHALL list major new features to be added
3. WHEN planning major version improvements THEN the system SHALL outline modularization efforts to improve maintainability
4. WHEN planning major version improvements THEN the system SHALL specify any breaking changes and migration paths
5. WHEN planning major version improvements THEN the system SHALL describe how the changes address identified limitations

### Requirement 5: Future Enhancements (v2.5+)

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to outline potential future enhancements beyond the next major release, so that I can communicate the long-term vision for the product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning future enhancements THEN the system SHALL describe optional integrations (e.g., RAG + local database, live voice control, web UI)
2. WHEN planning future enhancements THEN the system SHALL outline potential new capabilities to be explored
3. WHEN planning future enhancements THEN the system SHALL specify research areas that could lead to future improvements
4. WHEN planning future enhancements THEN the system SHALL categorize enhancements as short-term, medium-term, or long-term goals

### Requirement 6: Documentation Format

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the upgrade roadmap to be well-structured and readable in Markdown format, so that it can be easily shared and understood by all stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the roadmap document THEN the system SHALL use Markdown formatting for structured presentation
2. WHEN creating the roadmap document THEN the system SHALL include clear section headings and subheadings
3. WHEN creating the roadmap document THEN the system SHALL use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity where appropriate
4. WHEN creating the roadmap document THEN the system SHALL save the document as specified (either as a section in claude.md or as upgrade_plan.md)
5. WHEN creating the roadmap document THEN the system SHALL ensure the document is organized logically with a clear progression of ideas
